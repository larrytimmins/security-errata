### NOTICE:   All original copyright of original authors books remains in full force and in effect.  In a perfect world I would have
###   time to look up how each author wants to receive digital changes, etc.  Sometimes my time is not own, so this repository is 
###   an initial resting place for any errors in text, context, reference, code, etc that I find while doing my reviews of 15 to 20 
###   security related books per month.
###
###   if you use to share twitter, etc just please credit @larry_timmins and https://github.com/larrytimmins/security-errata
#
###   As mentioned already, I don't expect anything earth-shattering but just a running dialogue of errors I find them despite
###   the obviously momentus effort put in by all involved in the art of expression and pubications.
#   
###   
###   
Not an earth changer, but this seems as good a place as any to post errata in published books that I found while reading about digital forensics, red team, blue team, penetration tests, security engagement letters, cyber security, Linux, etc.
